## Assignment 4

## Weekly Recap

This week I went through an intro to DOM Manipulation and Arrays and Loops. DOM Manipulation without reloading the page is possible thanks to JavaScript, which powers most if not all modern web applications. With JavaScript, you can change the attributes of an HTML page and assign classes like "highlight" to different objects. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, and loops allow a set of instructions to be repeated multiple times. Square brackets is the preferred way of making arrays.
