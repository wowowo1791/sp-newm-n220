## Assignment 1: Git Readme

### Websites vs Web Applications

Websites are meant to be informational, only viewed or browsed, while applications are meant to complete a task. Both kind are created on the browser, use HTML and JS. Any code that comes from the server is parsed in the browser, which also disqualifies HTML from being a programming language.

### VS Code & Extensions

VS Code is used in conjunction with Git to code and provide a friendly user interface. You can send commits from VS Code to GitHub where changes can be public or private. Extensions generally help the app be more intuitive, but I have yet to see what they actually do.

### Version Control, Git, & GitHub

Any script or document that is worked on is going to have versions to it. GitHub provides version control, as well as ease of access through the program Git. You can download Visual Studio Code, sign into a GitHub account, and send commits to a repository.

### Markdown & Documentation

Markdown is used in many places, including GitHub and Reddit. Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to format plain text into HTML, which makes it easier to use and structure pages. It has many features to format and make a page appealing.
