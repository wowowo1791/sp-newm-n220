## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

The artifact in question is a basket from 1900s to the 1960s. It is threaded from willow or cottonwood along with cattail or bearglass foundation, devil's claw, and an overcast rim finish. A regular basket. I chose this artifact because of its ancient significance and its potential to hold items.

Brief description of your what your project is about and why you chose that topic.

### Core Webpages

One page will be used to showcase the basket. There's not a lot of fun to be had just staring at a basket, so a feature will be added to make it more interactive. Clicking the basket creates a random item on the page. It could be anything from a fortune cookie from a restaurant to an Ender Dragon egg from Minecraft. Items come from an API and include soap, a credit card, an apple, a needle, and more. Continuing to click the basket creates more items. If you don't like something, you can drag the item (image) back into the basket and it will disappear forever. Those are the two functions the core webpages offers.

List core webpages and briefly describe the page of them. Include intractable features for the web app.

### Design Choices

I'd use the EitelJorg website itself to influence my styling choices. The website is structured similarly to every other site on the web. Colors include white and orange, orange used for the font. An image of the artifact, the basket, is centered on page. Data structure includes storing positions of items in memory, and what items are on screen as well as how many.

List any websites that you might reference to influence your styling choices. List any colors used and what they were used for. 

Describe your data structure with rationale.
